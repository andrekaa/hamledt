Slovak National Corpus (SNK)

This folder takes the Treex data in which annotations from two annotators are
combined side-by-side in two zones, annotator1 and annotator2. See
../sk-match/poznamky.txt for details of how the data has been prepared. In
particular, trees that had some problems or that had been annotated only by
one annotator have not been included.

The normalization in this folder takes trees from one annotator and ignores
trees from the other, although they stay in the Treex files in their original
zones.
